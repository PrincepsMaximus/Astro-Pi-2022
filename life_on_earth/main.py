'''
This project contains all the code for our Mission Space Lab (Life on Earth) experiment.
First of all we want to see if we can (succesfully) detect cloud types autonomosly from space.
That would make the exploration of our hypothesis concerning the cloud coverage of Earth a lot easier:
"There is a notable difference in cloud types and density above the oceans/seas and land."
